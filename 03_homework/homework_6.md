**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

Homeworks 1-5 were well designed and was a crash-course on most commonly used SQL commands. 

In my previous work with databases ( not necessarily SQL) , I worked on questions and caching for the show " how to become a millionaire " at AWS, while the organizing and querying data I observed biases in how the parameters (column) in datastores
favored native English speakers over anything else. In my efforts to make the data pipeline more accessible, I gave columns agnostic , simple yet easily understood names.

At the CRA, where I worked on the T3 Modernization Project, handling sensitive taxpayer information was a significant responsibility. In hindsight, advocating for more robust data encryption techniques and anonymization processes would have been beneficial to protect user data further.
I would implement strict data governance policies that define clear guidelines for data access, storage, and sharing. Regular audits and compliance checks would also be crucial to ensure these policies are adhered to, minimizing the risk of data breaches and misuse.

To minimize inequity in data representation, a good approach would be to collect data from various cultural groups commensurate to their % of population. This would help represent various datapoints accurately and can enable more robust policy decisions.
